My name is Rebecca. I'm a software developer aspirant. I made this decision after years of considering a career path to pursue after school. I have ambitions to become a full-stack developer and then grow to become a software developer. 
Follow me on my journey. I will share my difficulties, successes and lessons learned along this path.

Let's dive into this together.
